# ✨Get to know Simran and this Repository! ✨

## 🖥 Purpose of this Repo
- Here's my STATS220 [*Website*](https://simranwadhawan.github.io/stats220/)
- I have created this repo to store my assignment contents for STATS220, and also create a professional portfolio for potential employers. Therefore, not only do I want them to see my projects, but also get to know me in a professional manner and as a person. 

## 💁🏽‍♀️ About ME

Alongside Studies, I also opened my own company in 2019 that specialises in event decoration and management. I have also recently finished my internship as a Shopper Marketer Intern at The Griffin's Food Company.
